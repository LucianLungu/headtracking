headtracking
============

This is the code for the working Head Tracking C# script, originally written by Johnny Lee.

This version is designed for Windows Vista x64/ Windows 7 x64.

Some changes will be needed in order for it to work, such as giving the exe file administrative rights and disabling some modules in the properties menu.

In order to make this work, you will need:

1. Windows 7 x64 machine with bluetooth enabled (dongle or incorporated)
2. A WiiMote
3. WiiMote ADC, software used to pair the Wimote with your computer permanently
4. A Wii Control bar (2 IR leds distanced at around 15cm)
5. DirectX SDK April 2007 or later
6. Visual C# 2010 Express
7. WiiDesktopRemote for Windows 7 x64
